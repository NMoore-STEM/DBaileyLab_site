# DBaileyLab_site

This repository is to get a feel for using GitHub and Git for version control during the creation of my portfolio pieces.

I am an NMSU alumni and worked under Dr. Bailey as a teaching assistant and as a herbarium curator during my undergrad.
The current website is a bit dated, so I thought of modernizing it as a good project as there is a considerable amount of content there to work with.

This project began towards the end of June 2020.  As of starting this website, I had previous experience writing HTML and CSS code, but no JavaScript experience before now.

I anticipate future projects will have smoother version control documentation as I intend to have more aspects of GitHub mastered.
