# Dr Bailey Lab Website

I chose this website for a project as I had prior working relationships with the people at the lab when I obtained my degree at NMSU. 
I worked under Dr. Bailey as a teaching assistant and as a herbarium curator during my undergrad.

The current website is a bit dated, so I thought of modernizing it as a good project as there is a considerable amount of content there to work with.

As of starting work on this website, I only had previous experience writing HTML and CSS code from back in 2013 and my first attempts in 2010.
This website was my first serious introduction to writing script, specifically, Jquery.

This repository was created to get a feel for using GitHub and Git for version control during the creation of my portfolio pieces.
I anticipate future projects will have smoother version control documentation as I intend to have more aspects of GitHub mastered.

I have extensive experience in version control systems as I often authored Standard Operating Procedures for ISO accredited labs during my career in that field.
Because of this, I understand the importance of utilizing such systems, especially for complex operations.

Through the course of developing this website, I have learned many many things. The most notable were how to manipulate HTML pseudo-elements, use script to monitor the position of the document in relation to the window
