# Lab Website

**This is one my earliest web dev projects.**<br>
**It is included in my portfolio to show how my coding has improved over time.**

### This website was built with:

+ DOM manipulation with javascript/ jquery
+ Identify and resolve cross-browser CSS compatibility issues
  
### Background
I chose this website for a project as I had prior working relationships with the people at the lab when I obtained my degree at NMSU. 
I worked under Dr. Bailey as a teaching assistant and as a herbarium curator during my undergrad.
  
As of starting work on this website, I only had previous experience writing HTML and CSS code from back in 2013 and my first attempts in 2010.
This website was my first serious introduction to writing script, specifically, Jquery.

This was also my first experience using GitHub, but I am very familiar with using version control systems.
When editing technical documents for labs, I followed ISO17025 (International Organization for Standardization) guidelines for version control.
Because of this, I understand the importance of utilizing such systems, especially for complex operations.
