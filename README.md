# Lab Website

**This is one my earliest web dev projects.**<br>
**It is included in my portfolio to show how my coding has improved over time.**

### This website was built with:

+ DOM manipulation with javascript/ jquery
+ Identify and resolve cross-browser CSS compatibility issues

### Background
I chose this website for a project as I had prior working relationships with the people at the lab when I obtained my degree at NMSU. 
I worked under Dr. Bailey as a teaching assistant and as a herbarium curator during my undergrad.

The current website is a bit dated, so I thought of modernizing it as a good project as there is a considerable amount of content there to work with.

As of starting work on this website, I only had previous experience writing HTML and CSS code from back in 2013 and my first attempts in 2010.
This website was my first serious introduction to writing script, specifically, Jquery.

This repository was created when I was very new to GitHub. I wanted to get a feel for how everything worked and take advantage of having free version control software to track my progress.
<!-- This repository was created to get a feel for using GitHub and Git for version control during the creation of my portfolio pieces.
I anticipate future projects will have smoother version control documentation as I intend to have more aspects of GitHub mastered. -->

I have extensive experience in version control systems as I often authored Standard Operating Procedures for ISO accredited labs during my career in that field.
Because of this, I understand the importance of utilizing such systems, especially for complex operations.<br>
